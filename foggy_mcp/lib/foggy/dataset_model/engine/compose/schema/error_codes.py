"""Frozen error codes for Compose Query schema-derivation failures.

These are **structural / correctness** errors (missing field references,
union column-count mismatch, join-on resolution failures) that occur
during plan-build / schema-derive phases. They are deliberately NOT
grouped under ``compose-sandbox-violation`` — sandbox codes are for
*security* enforcement (Layer A/B/C whitelists); schema codes are for
*correctness* (did the user write a structurally-valid plan?).

Cross-language invariant: every constant here must match the Java
``ComposeSchemaErrorCodes.java`` class byte-for-byte.
