    ----------
    allowed_functions:
        Set of function names the script may call.
    allowed_objects:
        Mapping of object_name → set of allowed method names.
        An empty set means the object is visible but no methods
        are allowed (useless but safe).
    allowed_scopes:
        Set of auth_scope values the current execution is entitled to.
    allowed_libraries:
        Set of controlled fsscript library names the script may import.
    allowed_symbols:
        Optional per-library symbol allow-list. If a library is allowed
        but absent from this mapping, every descriptor-declared export is
        allowed. If present, only the listed symbols are importable.
